Purpose:
Package the Debian Installer and a suitable kernel image for your device.

The Easy Way:
Download inird.buffalo and the uImage.buffalo.<model> for your device. Rename uImage.buffalo.<model> to uImage.buffalo

The Hard Way:
This method requires mkimage from the uboot-tools package and the DTB file obtained in the previous step.

Generate a Kernel image (uImage.buffalo):
1. Find the Debian armhf "network-console" installer files. For Stretch: http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/stretch/main/installer-armhf/current/images/network-console/
2. Download the kernel image (vmlinuz) from Debian's "network-console" installer page.
3. Append the DTB to the end of the kernel image: 
   cat vmlinuz armada-370-blahblah.dtb > kernelDTB
4. Generate the kernel uboot image using mkimage:
   mkimage -A arm -O linux -T Kernel -C none -a 0x00008000 -e 0x00008000 -n debian_installer -d kernelDTB uImage.buffalo

Generate the initrd image (initrd.buffalo):

The tools I am using to generate these images are found under the "build" directory along with the installer images. I'm basically using the "ssh-noninteractive" network-console installer provided by debian with a few tweaks to handle these devices better. 

Specifically, I've added logic to:

load the modules required to access the spi flash for the device at install time.
use fw_printenv to access the spi flash to determine the MAC address for each interface
change the MAC address for each interface to the proper one (rather than the random one set at startup)
load the files necessary for flash-kernel to automatically generate boot images (buffalo_devcies.db and dtb files)
hardcode the main interface's MAC address in /etc/network/interfaces
add entries in /etc/modules for the spi flash to work at startup.
add entry in /target/usr/share/initramfs-tools/conf.d/ to ensure devince ignores the "root=/dev/nfs" parameter passed by buffalo's bootloader
suppress the "no bootloader" warning (we're using the bootloader built into the device via flash-kernel)
install flash-kernel 
trigger flash-kernel at the end of the install process to generate the new uImage.buffalo and initrd.buffalo
