Purpose:
Copy the installer files (uImage.buffalo and initrd.buffalo) to the first partition/RAID array (/boot directory) on the device.

The Easyish way:
This can be accomplished a number of ways, the requirement is that the *.buffalo files end up on the first partiton of the drive which the device boots from. This partition must be formated using the EXT2 or EXT3 filesystem.

I prefer to start with a device already running Buffalo's firmware, this way you can reuse the existing RAID arrays and don't have to remove the drives, this is particularly nice for the 210/410 which require dissasembly to get access the drives.

If you are starting with a device running Buffalo's firmware:
1. Obtain a copy of acp_commander_cli.jar either from the Tools directory or from nas-central.org (defunct)
2. Use acp-commander to find the device's IP address if needed.
   java -jar acp_commander_cli.jar -f
3. Use acp_commander to send the command "chmod -R 777 /boot"
   java -jar acp_commander_cli.jar -t <device ip address> -ip <device ip address> -c "chmod -R 777 /boot" -pw <your admin password> 
4. Use acp_commander to send the command "busybox telnetd &"
   java -jar acp_commander_cli.jar -t 192.168.1.184 -ip 192.168.1.184 -c "busybox telnetd &" -pw password
5. Connect to the device via telnet, the username is "admin" and the password is your admin password for the device.
   $ telnet 192.168.1.184
   Trying 192.168.1.184...
   Connected to 192.168.1.184.

6. Navigate to the /boot directory.
    cd /boot
7. Copy the installer files from your PC using sftp or wget. You could also copy them to a network share on the device, then copy them to /boot from /mnt/disk.... or /mnt/array....


If your starting with blank drives and do not wish to install the Buffalo firmware first:
1. Create a partition table using gdisk/parted etc.
2. Create partition 1 with enough space for the installer files.
3. Format partition 1 ext3 using mkfs.ext3.
4. Mount the partiton and copy uImage.buffalo and initrd.buffalo to it.
5. Insert that drive into the device as Drive 1.   

Once the installer files are in place, reboot your device to start the installer.

You can also load the boot files via TFTP. The procedure for getting these devices to boot via TFTP varies a bit from device to device. I've linked to a decent article over at https://buffalonas.miraheze.org/wiki/Restoring_Stock_Firmware_via_TFTP
