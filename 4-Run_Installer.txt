Purpose:
Perform the actual install.

Note: the provided installer images now handle all the custom steps for you, the only requirement is that /boot is:
-located on the first partition of the first (or every) disk
-formatted as ext3
-either a regular partition or part of an MDADM array using metadata version 0.90
***if you use the partitions from a stock firmare install this will already be the case. 

The Easyish way:
1. Boot up the device, assuming everything went well it will boot into the debian installer and start the ssh-server.
2. It should come up with the same ip address as before. if you are unsure of the ip you can find it by scanning for devices listening on port 22 (ssh).
   nmap -p22 --open 192.168.1.*   or similar.
3. Connect to the device via ssh, the username is installer, the password is install.
4. Run through the installer like a typical Debian install (see details at the end). Note: Partition 1 still needs to be mounted as /boot and needs to be formatted as ext2 or ext3.
Stop when you get to the page where the installer fails to install Grub.


see the next document for notes on how to do some post-install setup.


The hardish way:
You can build your own installer image and make any customizations you might be interested in using generate_images.sh found in the build directory found with the installer images.
