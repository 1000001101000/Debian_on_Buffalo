## Quick Note about Debian Bullseye:

All the major issues with supporting older devices have been resolved, those fixes have been backported to Stretch/Buster as well. The only remaining limit is that devices with less than 128mb of ram need to use the "debootstrap" method rather than the ssh installer. 



I've moved all the documentation to the wiki:
