Tools for Installing/Running Debian on all ARM-based Buffalo Linkstation/Terastation devices.

If this project helps you click the Star at the top of the page to let me know! If you'd like to contribute to the continued development/maintenance consider clicking on the sponsor button.

In addition to the Issues and Discussions tabs on GitHub we now also have a Discord channel at https://discord.gg/2Js7ezAbzm or our IRC on Libera.Chat in the #miraheze-buffalonas channel!

<b>I could use some additional testers for upcoming changes to the installer processes, please reach out on discord if you'd be willing to help!</b>

## Quick Note about Debian Bullseye:

All the major issues with supporting older devices have been resolved, those fixes have been backported to Stretch/Buster as well. The only remaining limit is that devices with less than 128mb of ram need to use the "debootstrap" method rather than the ssh installer.
