based on previous work by Viral Shah <viral@debian.org>.

  (module rng-tools)

The Debian packaging of rng-tools is:
  Copyright (c) 2003-2010 by Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>,

Changes:
  The Debian version of rngd is extensively patched with added 
  functionality and bugs courtesy of Henrique de Moraes Holschuh.
  All changes were supposed to be proposed to be merged upstream, but the
  deviation got too large to handle, so it hasn't happened.  See upstream
  changelog for a list of all changes.
