Now that Kernel 4.19 has become the current TESTING Kernel, this included the fixes required to get Buster support working for these devices. I'm currently testing the new device trees and working through a some issues that are preventing the installer to work properly. I should have the first working version published shortly.

Please note that while Buster is still the "Testing" version of Debian there will likely be a fair number of new issues, some of which may cause major issues. In particular new versions of the Debian Kernel often require changes to the device-trees to be bootable and have all the hardware continue to function. 

Until Buster becomes the new "Stable" version I highly recommend sticking to Stretch.


Current issues:

lack of entropy for rng at boot:

At startup the random number generator does not report as ready until it can gather a certain amount of random data from the hardware. Services that require the rng to operate (mainly the ssh server) will not start until this completes. With the 4.19 kernel this has been taking 30-60 minutes rather than 10-15 seconds it previously took. 

This issue is discussed in detail here:

I've got a workaround set up based on haveged and rngd that allows the installer to run and for the resulting system to come up in a normal amount of time.
