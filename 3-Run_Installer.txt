Purpose:
Perform the actual install.

Note: the provided installer images now handle all the custom steps for you, the only requirement is that /boot is:
-located on the first partition of the first (or every) disk
-formatted as ext3
-either a regular partition or part of an MDADM array using metadata version 0.90
***if you use the partitions from a stock firmare install this will already be the case. 

see the next document for notes on how to do some post-install setup.
